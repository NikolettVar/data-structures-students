# data-structures-students
Higher Diploma in Computing, Software Development, Data Structures module. 
This small project was created as a practice exercise with singly linked lists in Java. 
Each node is capable of representing a student's information in an education institute.
Nodes contain the following information: Student Number, Student Name, Contact email, Year of registration, Annual Fees, Status (can be active, suspended) and Type 
(International, EU or Irish) The Node class should also provide a toString method. 
Methods implemented; 
2. isEmpty( ) – a method that checks if the linkedlist is empty and return a boolean value
3. get_status( ) – this method should return the status of a target node.
4. add( ) - this method should allow the addition of a new node into the linkedlist at the start of the current list 
5. remove - this method removes the first occurrence of the target node. The target is defined by student number.
